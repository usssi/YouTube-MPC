## About YouTube MPC

**YouTube MPC** is a Chrome Extension that transforms your numpad into an intuitive controller for sampling YouTube videos. Inspired by classic MPC workflows, it lets you instantly perform with video cues as if they were samples. Open any YouTube video and start creating!

Turn any YouTube video into a playable source. Map precise moments to your numpad keys (1-9) and trigger them instantly for live remixing, beat making, sound design, or creative analysis.

## Features

-   **Instant Numpad Triggering:** Play assigned YouTube timestamps instantly with Numpad 1-9.
-   **On-the-Fly Cue Capture:** While watching YouTube, press `Ctrl + Numpad (1-9)` to map the current moment to a pad.
-   **Performance Banks:** Organize samples across four banks (A, B, C, D). Switch using Numpad `/`, `*`, `-`, `+`.
-   **Expressive Playback Modes:** Choose "1-Shot" (trigger and play) or "Hold" (play only while held down) per bank. Toggle with `Ctrl + Numpad .`.
-   **MPC-Style Control Panel:** Click the extension icon for an interface to manage cues, fine-tune timings (`.00` precision), rename banks, set modes, and more.
-   **Save/Load Banks:** Save your bank configurations (`.json` files) and load them back anytime. Build your sample kit library!
-   **Quick On/Off Toggle:** Enable/disable numpad control instantly with Numpad `.` (Decimal).
-   **Stop Control:** Use `Numpad 0` to stop playback.

## Getting Started
> Check full [Keyboard Shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts)

1.  Open any YouTube video page in your browser â€“ this is your sound source!
2.  Ensure the extension is ON (check for the Green or Yellow colored icon in your Chrome toolbar). Select your active Bank using Numpad `/`, `*`, `-`, or `+`, or by clicking the desired bank button (A/B/C/D) in the extension panel (opened via the toolbar icon).
3.  While focused on the YouTube video player, find your sample points and press `Ctrl + Numpad (1-9)` to instantly map/record the current time to that key (while pressing `Ctrl` check for Red colored icon in your Chrome toolbar).
4.  Perform your samples! Press `Numpad (1-9)` anytime while on the YouTube page to trigger playback from your saved cue points. (`Numpad 0` stops playback).
5.  Need to fine-tune? Click the YouTube MPC icon to open the control panel. Here you can manually edit timestamps with two-decimal (`.00`) precision, rename banks, switch playback modes, and Save/Load your banks. (Remember, keyboard shortcuts only work when the YouTube page/tab itself is active, not when the popup panel is focused).
